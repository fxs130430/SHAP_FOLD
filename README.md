# SHAP_FOLD
This is the First Implementation of FOLD (First Order Learner of Default) algorithm. FOLD is an ILP algorithm that learns a hypothesis from a background knowledge represented as normal logic program, with two disjoint sets of Positive and Negative examples. Learning hypotheses in terms of default theories (i.e., default and exceptions) outperforms Horn based ILP algorithms in terms of classification evaluation measures. It also significantly decreases the number of induced clauses. For more information about the original FOLD algorithm and learning default theories kindly refer to the [FOLD paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02693.pdf "FOLD paper").
